# E-Commerce Website
Similar to BestBuy's website

This Project was completed and tested with WampServer. WampServer was used to locally host the sql database and website of this project.

In this project, I used PHP and SQL to design and create a web based database. I learned about the importance of good design practices for relational databases and how to create a simple front-end website to incoporate a back-end database.

## OVERVIEW
In the front-end, this website is able to login existing users/admins and register new users through using sql server encryption for their passwords. Users and admins can select products and put them into a cart, where they can place their order. Their orders display whether or not the products have been shipped or delivered. Admins have the privilege to add new products to the website and view the amount of stock for each individual product. All of the data is stored into a sql database.
